# Palindrome Number Checker (C Project)

##  Project Overview

The **Palindrome Number Checker** is a simple C program that checks whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

Example:

* 121 → Palindrome
* 123 → Not a Palindrome

This project is beginner-friendly and helps in understanding basic concepts of C programming such as loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

##  Project Utility

This project is useful for:

* Learning number manipulation in C
* Understanding `while` loops and conditional statements
* Practicing logic building for competitive programming
* Using modulo (`%`) and division (`/`) operators effectively

It can also be used as a base logic for more advanced problems involving digit processing.

##  Need for the Project

The need for this project arises from:

* Helping beginners understand how to reverse a number
* Improving problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Introducing real-world use of loops and conditions
* Building a strong foundation for future programming concepts

Such programs are commonly asked in exams, interviews, and viva sessions.

##  Future Scope

This project can be extended in several ways:

* Add support for negative numbers
* Modify the program to check **palindrome strings**
* Create a menu-driven program for multiple checks
* Implement the same logic using functions
* Convert it into a GUI-based application
* Rewrite the program in other languages like Java or Python

##  Technologies Used

* Programming Language: **C**
* Compiler: GCC / Turbo C
